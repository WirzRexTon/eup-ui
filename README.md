## About The Project

I did this out of boredom, because I saw that the default eup-ui was very old (Due to NativeUI - 0.18 menu not open). So I changed this with RageUI which consumes 0.0 ms menu close.  

## Getting Started

### Installation : 

1. Update the information about your database in the server.cfg
   ```sh
    ensure eup-stream 
    ensure eup-ui
   ```
4. Start your server and type /eup in the chat to open the menu. 

### Disclaimer

Everyone in the game has access to this menu.
